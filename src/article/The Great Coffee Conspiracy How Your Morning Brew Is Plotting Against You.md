Every morning millions of people blindly consume their sacred cup of coffee, unaware that their steaming mug might be the beginning of a grand, caffeinated conspiracy. Buckle up — it’s time to spill the beans.

## The Origin of the Plot
Legend has it that coffee was discovered by a goat herder who noticed his goats acting jittery after munching on some mysterious berries. But what if those berries were never meant to be eaten? What if, instead, they were a secret weapon devised by the global coffee cartel to control humanity one espresso shot at a time?

The sudden surge in coffee shops around every corner is no accident. It’s a carefully orchestrated operation, designed to infiltrate your daily routine and claim a stake in your brain’s dopamine receptors. Think about it: why else would your local café know your name and your order without you saying a word?

## Signs You’re Already a Victim

- You can’t function without coffee before 10 AM.
- Your caffeine intake has skyrocketed but productivity remains suspiciously stagnant.
- You’ve tried to quit, only to find yourself standing in line at the coffee shop again by lunchtime.

If any of these sound familiar, congratulations! You’re officially part of the conspiracy.

## Resistance Is Futile, But Here’s How to Pretend You’re Trying
If you want to break free from the caffeinated chains, start by switching to decaf. But beware — it’s basically coffee in denial, and your brain will know. Alternatively, herbal teas can be your allies, though they come with their own set of conspiracies (looking at you, chamomile).

And remember: the next time you’re sipping that latte, you’re not just waking up — you’re waking up *to* the system.
